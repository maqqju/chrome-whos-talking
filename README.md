# chrome-whos-talking
## Motivation
This is [time-whos-talking](https://github.com/maqqju/time-whos-talking) repository wrapped in a Chrome Extension that, when the browser is using a VOIP, listens to events so as to automatically keep track of who is talking.

### Limitations
So far this extension only tracks Zoom meetings (opened through Google Chrome).

## Instructions
* Load the extension to your Google Chrome
* Open a Zoom call from Google Chrome
* Click on the extension icon to start tracking
* When finished, click the extension icon again to download the logs
* Logs will be downloaded as a CSV file
