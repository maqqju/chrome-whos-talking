# chrome-whos-talking
## Motivation
This is [time-whos-talking](https://github.com/maqqju/time-whos-talking) repository wrapped in a Chrome Extension that, when the browser is using a VOIP, listens to events so as to automatically keep track of who is talking.

### VOIP Platforms Tracked so far:
 * Zoom
 * MS Teams


## Instructions
* Load the extension to your Google Chrome
* Open a Zoom/MS Teams call from Google Chrome
* Click on the extension icon to start tracking
* When finished, click the extension icon again to download the logs
* Logs will be downloaded as a CSV file

### Known issues
This project is in its infancy, so there will surely be a lot of problems. The following are some known challenges:
* The extension icon needs replacement
* When multiple people talk at the same time some information might be lost
* For MS Teams, person doing the tracking does not emit any signals when they are talking - so far they cannot be traced
